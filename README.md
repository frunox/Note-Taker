# _NOTE-TAKER_

## Description

This application can write, save, and delete notes. It uses an express backend, and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

## Installation

Clone the repository, run npm install, and execute the server.js file.

## Usage

After starting the server, the user can go to the browser to start entering new notes.  The new notes are dynamically written to the JSON file and re-rendered as they are created.  Clicking on the trash can icon deletes the selected note, which is also deleted from the JSON file.

## License

See the accompanying LICENSE file.

## Contributing

The developer thanks Jason Kroening, Cynthia Arbit, Patrick Cain and Chris Wells.  We all appreciated the assistance of Arron Linton and Kieran Anthony at critical steps in the development process.
